#ex1  
Fill a 2DBinaryStringChromosome with alternating 0s and 1s using a
SimpleGA.

#ex2
Generate a sequence of random numbers, then use a Bin2DecChromosome
and SimpleGA to try and match the sequence.  This example shows how
to use the user-data member of genomes in objective functions.

#ex3
Read a 2D pattern from a data file then try to match the pattern using
a 2DBinaryStringChromosome and a SimpleGA.  This example also shows
how to use the GAParametes object for setting genetic algorithm
parameters and reading command-line arguments.

#ex4
Fill a 3DBinaryStringChromosome with alternating 0s and 1s using a
SteadyStateGA.  This example uses many member functions of the genetic
algorithm to control which statistics are recorded and dumped to file.

#ex5
This example shows how to build a composite genome (a cell?) using
a 2DBinaryStringGenome and a Bin2DecGenome. The composite genome uses
behaviors that are defined in each of the genomes that it contains.
The objective is to match a pattern and sequence of numbers.

#ex6
Grow a GATreeGenome<int> using a SteadyStateGA. This example
illustrates the use of specialized methods to override the default
initialization method and to specialize the output from a tree. It
also shows how to use templatized genome classes. Finally, it shows
the use of the parameters object to set default values then allow these
to be modified from the command line. The objective function in this
example tries to grow the tree as large as possible.

#ex7
Identical in function to example 3, this example shows how to use the
increment operator (++), completion measure, and other member functions
of the GA. It uses a GA with overlapping populations rather than the
non-overlapping GA in example 3 and illustrates the use of many of the
GA member functions. It also illustrates the use of the parameter list
for reading settings from a file, and shows how to stuff a genome with
data from an input stream.

#ex8
Grow a GAListGenome<int> using a GA with overlapping populations.
This shows how to randomly initialize a list of integers, how to use
the sigma truncation scaling object to handle objective scores that
may be positive or negative, and the 'set' member of the genetic
algorithm for controlling statistics and other genetic algorithm
parameters.

#ex9
Find the maximum value of a continuous function in two variables. This
example uses a GABin2DecGenome and simple GA. It also illustrates
how to use the GASigmaTruncationScaling object (rather than the default
linear scaling). Sigma truncation is particularly useful for
objective functions that return negative values.

#ex10
Find the maximum value of a continuous, periodic function. This
example illustrates the use of sharing to do speciation. It defines
a sample distance function (one that does the distance measure based
on the genotype, the other based on phenotype). It uses a binary-
to-decimal genome to represent the function values.

#ex11
Generate a sequence of descending numbers using an order-based list.
This example illustrates the use of a GAListGenome as an
order-based chromosome. It contains a custom initializer and shows
how to use this custom initializer in the List genome.

#ex12
Alphabetize a sequence of characters. Similar to example 11, this
example illustrates the use of the GAStringGenome (rather than a
list) as an order-based chromosome.

#ex13
This program runs a GA-within-GA. The outer level GA tries to
match the pattern read in from a file. The inner GA tries to match
a sequence of randomly generated numbers (the sequence is generated
at the beginning of the program's execution). The inner level GA is
run only when the outer GA reaches a threshhold objective score.

#ex14
Another illustration of how to use composite chromosomes. In this
example, the composite chromosome contains a user-specifiable number
of lists. Each list behaves differently and is not affected by
mutations, crossovers, or initializations of the other lists.

#ex15    
The completion function of a GA determines when it is "done". This
example uses the convergence to tell when the GA has reached the
optimum (the default completion measure is number-of-generations).
It uses a binary-to-decimal genome and tries to match a sequence of
randomly generated numbers.

#ex16
Tree chromosomes can contain any kind of object in the nodes. This
example shows how to put a point object into the nodes of a tree to
represent a 3D plant. The objective function tries to maximize the
size of the plant.

#ex17
Array chromsomes can be used when you need tri-valued alleles. This
example uses a 2D array with trinary alleles.

#ex18
This example compares the performance of three different genetic
algorithms. The genome and objective function are those used in
example 3, but this example lets you specify which type of GA you
want to use to solve the problem. You can use steady state, simple,
or incremental just by specifying one of them on the command line.
The example saves the generational data to file so that you can then
plot the convergence data to see how the performance of each genetic
algorithm compares to the others.

#ex19
The 5 DeJong test problems.

#ex20
Holland's royal road function. This example computes Holland's 1993
ICGA version of the Royal Road problem. Holland posed this problem as
a challenge to test the performance of genetic algorithms and
challenged other GA users to match or beat his performance.

#ex21
This example illustrates various uses of the allele set in array
genomes. The allele set may be an enumerated list of items or a
bounded range of continuous values, or a bounded set of discrete
values. This example shows how each of these may be used in
combination with a real number genome.

#ex22
This example shows how to derive a new genetic algorithm class in
order to customize the replacement method. Here we derive a new type
of steady-state genetic algorithm in which speciation is done more
effectively by not only scaling fitness values but also by controlling
the way new individuals are inserted into the population.

#ex23
The genetic algorithm object can either maximize or minimize your
objective function. This example shows how to use the minimize
abilities of the genetic algorithm. It uses a real number genome with
one element to find the maximum or minimum of a sinusoid.

#ex24
This example shows how to restricted mating using a custom genetic
algorithm and custom selection scheme. The restricted mating in the
genetic algorithm tries to pick individuals that are similar (based
upon their comparator). The selector chooses only the upper half of
the population (so it cannot choose very bad individuals, unlike the
roulette wheel selector, for example).

#ex25
Multiple populations on a single CPU. This example uses its own
genetic algorithm class called a 'DemeGA'. The genetic algorithm
controls the migration behavior for moving individuals between
populations.

#ex26
Travelling Salesperson Problem. Although genetic algorithms are not
the best way to solve the TSP, we include an example of how it can
be done. This example uses an order-based list as the genome to
figure out the shortest path that connects a bunch of towns such that
each town is visited exactly once. It uses the edge recombination
crossover operator (you can try it with the partial match crossover
as well to see how poorly PMX does on this particular problem).

#ex27
Deterministic crowding. Although the algorithms built-in to GAlib
allow you to do quite a bit of customization, sometimes you'll want to
derive your own class so that you can really tweak the way the
algorithm works. This example shows one way of implementing the
deterministic crowding method by deriving an entirely new genetic
algorithm class.

#randtest
Use this program to verify that the random number generator is
generating suitably random numbers on your machine. This is by no
means a comprehensive random number test suite, but it will give you
some idea of how well GAlib's random number generator is working.
